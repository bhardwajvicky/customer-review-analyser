Very poor insurer:
- Premium is charged monthly but there are regular increases in the premium every 3-4 months.
-Claims process is glitchy and unlike other insurers they are not very proactive in communicating the claim progress.
Service is below par compared to other insurers and although policy started out as competitively cheap, they are now more expensive.
