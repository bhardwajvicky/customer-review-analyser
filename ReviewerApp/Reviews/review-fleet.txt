Everyone I dealt with in this organisation was incompetent in some way. They rely heavily on automated emails and processes, the (shared) phone number is almost always answered by someone with no connection to your case and thus no real incentive or ability to assist. They specialise in sending long emails containing assurances of ‘we’ll take it from here’ personal service that never eventuate. My car delivery was postponed twice; once because they had not allowed enough time for the finance provider to go through their equally painfully slow administrative process; a second time because they had included ‘non-tangible’ items in the lease that could not in fact be financed at all. Then again, who could have thought of such a detail? I suppose only a person who did this full time and professionally and had actually done it before could really be expected to…but.. hang on…...  I must have signed a dozen proposals, amended proposals, and finance agreements and made about 30 essentially fruitless phone calls before finally getting the car on the last possible delivery day (a Tesla). To top it all off I got a request to sign a new lease agreement a week after I’d picked the car up. I had in fact already signed and returned it weeks ago but it had clearly been missed. I will say this company is extraordinary in one respect though, and that is how any organisation so completely disorganized, haphazard, and incapable of providing even basic customer service can survive.
